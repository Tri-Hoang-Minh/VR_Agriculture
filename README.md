# How to Import Unity Generated Folders into Your Local Repository

Hello! This guide will walk you through importing folders from a Unity project into your local repository.

## Note

Currently, the folders generated by Unity during runtime will not be present in the repository on GitHub. To run the project, you'll need to manually import these folders into your local repository if necessary.

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine if you haven't already done so. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

    Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Locate Unity Generated Folders**: Copy the "library" folder from the drive link below into your project.
